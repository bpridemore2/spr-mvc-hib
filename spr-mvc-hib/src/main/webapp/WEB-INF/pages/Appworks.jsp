<p>              <b>For:</b> Federal State and Local Chief Information Officers (CIO's) and Application Development Directors/managers and Data Center managers,

<p><b>Who:</b> are interested in reducing time to market and costs for their system development and deployment efforts and have the need to be agile to continually changing priorities and requirements.</p>

<p><b>What is it?:</b> AppWorks is a family of service and product offerings designed to accelerate the adoption of agile development methods and the use of best-in-class application lifecycle management/DevOps tools.  The services encapsulated within AppWorks are referred to as AppWorks Method and include the coaching, consulting, know-how and org change services required to guide development teams in their path to agile.  The products within AppWorks include pre-integrated tools configured to support the entire lifecycle of each release, from release planning to automating software deployments and are configured to align to agile development processes.  One variant of the AppWorks product offering is referred to as AppWorks Jazz which is based on the integration of IBM Rational Team Concert CLM tools.  The other AppWorks product offering, AppWorks Open integrates open source and other best-in-class tools configured to support multiple agile teams performing agile development.</p>

<p><b>That:</b> removes barriers for start-up or mature development teams adopting agile development processes and leveraging enterprise class application lifecycle management/DevOps tools.  AppWorks Method accelerates agile adoption by providing the coaching and know-how for teams to get going with agile.  AppWorks Jazz and AppWorks Open offer preintegrated enterprise class tools configured for agile development processes on a subscription basis that improves efficiency and automation.</p>

<p><b>Unlike:</b></p>
<ul class="alternate" type="square">
	<li>Partial solutions offered by ALM product vendors that  span only some of the process  phases, resulting in significant visibility/metric capture and efficiency issues</li>
	<li>Services offered by specialist agile methodology companies who offer expertise in helping teams adopt  agile development practices with minimal tools support</li>
	<li>D-I-Y development teams researching tools, acquiring licenses, operationalizing the ALM solution</li>
</ul>


<p><b>Differentiation:</b> Our end-to-end lifecycle—from  concept to deploy (DevOps)—combines cross functional Agile development and coaching with automated delivery of systems into production eliminating backlogs and providing error free continuous deployments.</p>

<p><b>Result:</b> Forrester case studies show significant benefit from Agile:  included improved time to benefit by 69%, reduced cost by 57%, reduced effort by 62%, and reduced critical defects by nearly 80%. Key findings from the Puppet Labs 2013 State of DevOps Report identify that high-performing organizations are deploying code 30 times faster with 50 percent fewer failures; 82% of these organizations have automated code deployment.</p> </p>
